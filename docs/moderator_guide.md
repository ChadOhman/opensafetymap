This guide explains the responsibilities and workflows for moderators on OpenSafetyMap.

---

## 🔑 Becoming a Moderator
- Admins assign moderator roles to trusted users.  
- Moderators can manage reports, comments, and users within the platform.  

---

## 📋 Moderation Dashboard

The **Moderation Dashboard** is your main workspace. It provides:  
- Pending reports awaiting review  
- Flagged reports and comments  
- User directory (for admins)  
- Moderation history log (immutable)  

---

## 📝 Reviewing Reports

### Pending Reports
- Review details, location, severity, and any uploaded photos.  
- Approve → Report is published.  
- Reject → Report is hidden; reason must be logged.  

### Approved Reports
- Can be revisited if later flagged.  
- Moderators may remove or reclassify if incorrect.

## 🚩 Handling Flags

When a user flags content:  
1. Open the **Flagged Content Queue**.  
2. Review the report or comment.  
3. Choose an action:  
   - **Dismiss** → No violation found.  
   - **Remove** → Content violates guidelines.  
4. Log a moderation note (required).  

---

## 👥 User Management

- View user profiles (public/private).  
- Apply bans/unbans:  
  - Temporary or permanent.  
  - Logged with a note in moderation history.  

(Admins only: Promote/demote moderators and change user roles.)  

---

## 🗂️ Moderation Log

- Every action is **immutable** and timestamped.  
- Includes moderator name, action, target, and notes.  
- Used for accountability and transparency.  

---

## ⚖️ Best Practices

- Be consistent with community guidelines.  
- Document every decision with clear notes.  
- Stay respectful and impartial.  
- When in doubt, escalate to an Admin.
