## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChadOhman/opensafetymap.git
cd accident-reports
```

2. **Start the stack with Docker Compose**  
```bash
make up
```

This will spin up:
- **app** → PHP + Apache web app (http://localhost:8080)  
- **db** → MySQL database (port 3306, user `root`, pass `example`)  

3. **Seed the database**  
```bash
make seed
```

This will import `seed.sql` into the MySQL database.

4. **Visit the app**  
Open your browser:  
👉 [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
