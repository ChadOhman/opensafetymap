## 🔑 Becoming an Admin

- Only project maintainers or trusted superusers are assigned this role.

## ⚙️ System Settings

Admins can configure platform-wide settings via the **Admin Dashboard**:  
- **Require approval for reports** → Toggle whether new reports must be approved before publishing.  
- **Enable/disable user registration** → Temporarily close sign-ups if needed.  
- **System announcements** → Post updates to all users.

## 👥 Role Management

Admins can manage user roles:  
- Promote a user → Moderator or Admin.  
- Demote a moderator → Back to user.  
- Ban/unban users → Temporary or permanent.  

> ⚠️ Only admins can change roles. Moderators cannot promote/demote.
