## ‚ú® Coding Standards

- **PHP**:  
  - Use PDO prepared statements for all queries.  
  - Follow PSR-12 coding style where possible.  
  - Keep business logic inside API files, reusable helpers in `/db/`.  

- **JavaScript**:  
  - Use ES6 modules (`import/export`).  
  - Favor async/await with `try/catch` for fetch calls.  
  - Keep UI logic in dedicated JS modules (`map.js`, `report_submission.js`, etc.).  

- **CSS**:  
  - Use shared `style.css` for consistency.  
  - Prefer utility classes and avoid inline styles.  

- **Docs**:  
  - Update `README.md` and `QUICKSTART.md` if your changes impact setup.  
  - Add JSDoc/PHPDoc comments where appropriate.

  - Moderation dashboard workflows  
  - Analytics dashboard
